I believe there are a load of 'Toff' producers with a very strange idea about what many of us 'Plebs' like to watch. Surely they could have asked someone who knew about restorations to look it over.\r\n\nHaving switched off before halfway through I can only assume, from comments on here, the programme didn't redeem itself in the second half...","13":"Make your opinion known - I have-\r\n\n\ncustomerservices@channel5.com","14":"Times like this I wish I had shares in Isopon \n\n\nRJ","15":"The guy had a very fancy magnet, perhaps we should all get one... it's probably what the trade use. ","16":"I switched off part way,it was total twaddle.\r\n\nI'm not sure I heard it right but I'm sure they said Jaguar invented IRS as drivers were finding it difficult to handle the car as it was so long?.\r\n\nThe restoration was a bodge and looked like it was done in twenty one days.\r\n\nI agree,it was like an episode of Eastenders,a poor one even by their standards.","17":"Programmes like this emphasise how important it is to keep a close eye on any restorer entrusted with one's pride-and-joy. I imagine pukka restoration companies cringed when they saw this.\r\n\n\nAlthough the valuation seemed a little optimistic, I'm glad the fella from RM at least pointed out the hideous sunroof, change of colour, and it being auto and LHD as being some of the car's less attractive points.\r\n\n\nRJ","18":"I completely forgot to set the box to record this, but from here and another thread it sounds as if I had a lucky escape.","19":"Yet he still valued it at \u00c2\u00a330,000!","20":"And would anyone looking for a 2+2 really consider this one, assuming they had a clue about old cars? Perhaps if it came at the right price, and a prospective purchaser wanted to fit one with a period-correct Webasto roof, but otherwise ...?\r\n\n\nR","21":"I'm hearing the whole thing was a set up anyway, nothing was real about this programme apparently. Even the breakers yard was fake and a mate of his with staged parts in.\r\n\n\nI haven't watched it, don't think I'll bother either.","22":"Same here thought we would give it a look but WHY does everything have to be so staged do they think we are that thick that we will not notice!","23":"I tried to watch 10 mins of it last night. What a load of rubbish. Staged parts, an ego trip for the so called presenter, and some terrible over acting when they started the thing up and it smoked.\r\n\nI've taken that of my future planner on sky!!","24":"I wonder why when there are so many people the shows organisers could have consulted,that they ended up with a couple who make Arthur Dailey look like mechanic of the year.\r\n\nDid they really believe anyone with the faintest interest in classic cars would find the program at all informative?.Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy.","25":"Probably produced by Bernie's Broadcasting Company, I can't think anyone else would cast him. \r\n\nBTW - it's repeated this evening.","26":"Excellent - I can miss it twice!","27":"I guess that anyone who was associated with the Kray's  can't be all bad.  \n\n\ncan they ?","28":"Fortunately it clashes with the Goodwood Revival on ITV4","29":"Well, I couldn't resist it. After everyone's comments I had to go on line and watch it. It was so awful that I may watch the next one for a laugh.  My opinion of Adrian Flux as  sponsor has slipped, however. Would you as part of a serious car restoration industry want to be associated with this sort of thing?\r\n\nI wondered why they wasted the first part of the programme with the odious Bernie insulting people on the phone and making rude comments about their cars and asking prices.The car 'as found' looked as if it had been decorated to appear rougher than it was, and the whole thing was vaguely reminiscent of the extremely stagey  'Pimp my Ride' series. No attempt to talk about what sort of state the underbody might be in and no attempt to derust the inside of the shell. The episode with the carbs, totally spurious. \r\n\nAnd as for the guy walloping the nosecone with a hammer.....pass the filler!\r\n\n\nAnd then the valuer doesn't even bend down and look underneath...sorry, I prefered scrapheap challenge.","30":"Watched it last night ~ twas awful.... \r\n\n\nBernie should have stuck to Banglar Bangers","31":"I thought exactly the same, so watched on line   it was dire, the director clearly unsure who his intended audience was.\r\n\n\nWhat was annoying is that they really didn't show any restoration, the engine work was glossed over with the statement that \"a piston was fixed\" , the body was taken back to bare metal (not a normal bodgers technique) but we didn't see  how they tackled any of the body faults that must have been present in a 50 year old car   ok there was some tapping down of \"high's\" on the bonnet; staged for the camera, and we saw the filler applied, but was it an inch thick or just a few thou?. I suspect it was the latter as the body blokes turned out what (on the TV) looked pretty good; nice paint equal panel gaps, but the implication was that the body was \"full of filler\"\r\n\n\nWhy they made a program that went out of its way to seem to promote bodging; not spent 5 quid on some metal and an hours labour on getting rid of the sunroof, why imply they were fitting secondhand, brake discs, exhaust components and shock's, why stage the phoney crash and make a big deal of surplus oil in the carbs, when they could have at least explained the original misfire...\r\n\n\nI think it should have been called \"Carry on Restoration\" then at least we could have laughed at it!\r\n\n\nDave","32":"I watched it last night, on a \"so bad it's good\" basis. Yes, the \"fixed a worn piston\" bit was interesting, just mentioned in passing, in fact I wonder if it was a brake piston and they just didn't mention that to make it sound more complicated. I also thought it might be a bit hard to have painted the inside of the bonnet red without removing either it or the engine, but I don't know E-types that well. I guess there's a chance the PO had done that, as it looked like he had started painting red around it.\r\n\n\nWould you use an angle grinder with a grinding disc to remove paint on an E-type? I wouldn't. No wonder they roughed the surface of the metal up so much.\r\n\n\nThe crash bit was pathetic. An otherwise empty section of garage, strangely-voiced bloke (Alfa Romero? What's an Alfa Romero?) backs slowly into an engine that has no business being there, and it sticks a big dent in the lower quarter panel? No chance. Hard to see why it was much more than a small scrape in real life.\r\n\n\nI have trouble believing that second-hand brake disc was going anywhere near the E-type, and I was quite surprised we got as far as the first ad break and they still hadn't bought the car. Would even have been better if they'd stop assuming we have the memories of a goldfish and keep re-showing bits of the program we only watched ten minutes ago![\/b]","33":"I agree with all that has been said, really unsatisfying programme.\r\n\n\nI noted the car started off with California style bonnet mounted lights that had disappeared in the finished views. \r\n\n\nNo mention if the vehicle had been through a SVA following re-import.\r\n\n\nThe valuer did not appear to peruse any documents prior to putting a value on it. What was the value? Retail, Auction?? \r\n\n\n4 weeks, 7 mechanics, Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum and they only made \u00c2\u00a310,000, not much of a business plan?\r\n\n\nBest get it back to California before it rusts and the P38 falls off like fish scales.","34":"I think its worse than that; Cost of mechanics can't be any less than \u00c2\u00a3200 per day, I think there were 4  of them?  for 4 weeks= \u00c2\u00a3200*4*20(days)= \u00c2\u00a316,000. Cost of car \u00c2\u00a312,000, leaving \u00c2\u00a32k for all the parts, trim, paint, overheads etc......

I used to have a 911 of that era, they use a Capacitive Discharge ignition system, this requires all HT components to be in tip top condition otherwise misfires are common, HT leads, cap & rotor arm would be changed at least every 2 years, they weren't  expensive... cleaning the cap up is akin to putting tyre paint on a nearly bald tyre  \n\n\nDave","54":"Shouty shouty shouty, although I managed to watch all of it this week rather than the week before.\r\n\n\nIt makes Wheeler dealers seem half decent.\r\n\n\nIt would be interesting to find out who wins the car!","55":"If it was you, would you admit to it?","56":"No, I would be quite worried!","57":"Maybe not admit to it, but I'd be very happy to win it, then sell it for whatever it achieved so that I could buy something better.\r\n\n\nR","58":"I Find that if I watch it as a comedy, a sort of The Muppet Show run a garage, it's very funny.

Then come back later and give \u00c2\u00a3250 for just the front seats.

I mean, they take more than two weeks to restore a car, they over-run on costs, their estimates for restoration are realistic as are their time schedules but they are very interesting people and are building a Bugatti Aerolithe from just photos - and in magnesium just like the original.

I would imagine anyone who has some actual knowledge of any of the subjects covered by these things will be similarly outraged - property developers, antiques dealers, specialist transport companies.\r\n\n\nThey're OK for what they are, there's always a cliff-hanger for the ad breaks to give the viewer time to get another can of cheap lager and get rid of the remnants of the last one.
